I don't want to share my research work, instead, I'll give an introduction to
how I organize my scientific life. So, it's meta-research.

How to organize your scientific life? The simple answer is, by blog posting and note taking.
I read LIU WeiPeng's *Dark Time* years ago, there's an article annalysing why
you should start writing blogs right now. It's convincing, so I began blog posting.

My blog is personal project, started last september, evolving all the time, now
becomes an integrated blog posting system. The three main parts are github,
travis-ci, and qiniu. They play different roles in the system and combined
together provide me great convenience for tracking my ideas, developing my
ideas, and sharing my ideas.

GitHub, offiers a code-hosting service. You can see my blog source code here,
and my activities. I made most of the contributions in winter, that's why
there is a peak.

GitHub the website is easy to use, but I recommend you to use the command-line
interface.  Instead of the official GitHub for windows. After you know how to
clone a repo, how to commit a change, and how to push your commits, you can
have fun on GitHub.

Then you can write your blogs in markdown, and host all your staffs on GitHub.

    :   The bcp utility is a tool for extracting subsets of Boost, it's useful for
        Boost authors who want to distribute their library separately from Boost,
        and for Boost users who want to distribute a subset of Boost with their
        application.

Travis-ci is a build system. You should write a `.travis.yml` (dot travis dot
yamal file), to configure how travis process your blog posts. if you know
Linux, it's straightforward and simple.  It's just several shell scripts. I use
travis to convert my markdown file to html, then upload to qiniu.

Qiniu is a CDN, it offers 10 Gigabytes of storage for free. And also several
command-line tools for file uploading.

When I commit some changes to my repo, travis will be notified (there's a hook).
It'll build my website under my instructions and upload to qiniu, then you
can visit it, at <blog.tangzhixiong.com>.

So, there are two hosting services: GitHub to store my sources files, Qiniu to
store my website html files.  And one temporary build system, Ubuntu, which
helps me automate the conversion from markdown file to htmls.
