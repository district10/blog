Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best
But expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power
But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is wrong
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders
We're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young

Some are like water
Some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later
They all will be gone
Why don't they stay young

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We'll let them come true
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young
